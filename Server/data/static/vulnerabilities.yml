      title: 'Eternal Blue [EXAMPLE]'
      description: >-
        <p>EternalBlue (MS17-010) is a critical vulnerability in Microsoft's
        Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which allows remote code execution
        on Windows systems. Discovered in 2017 and allegedly developed by the
        NSA, EternalBlue exploits a flaw in SMBv1, enabling attackers to gain
        unauthorized access to vulnerable machines.</p><p>By leveraging this
        exploit, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the target system with
        high privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise. The
        vulnerability became infamous for its role in the rapid spread of
        ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya, which caused
        widespread damage to organizations worldwide.</p><p>Affected systems
        include unpatched versions of Windows operating systems, such as Windows
        XP, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008.
        EternalBlue's impact is severe due to its ability to spread laterally
        across networks, making it possible for attackers to quickly infiltrate
        and propagate through unprotected environments.</p>
      observation: >-
        <p>During the penetration test, the EternalBlue vulnerability (MS17-010)
        was identified on several hosts within the target network. The
        vulnerability was exploited to gain unauthorized access, resulting in
        full control of the affected systems.<br></p><img class="custom-image"

        091357.png"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>Testing was conducted using the
        Metasploit Framework, and successful exploitation resulted in remote
        code execution, demonstrating that the EternalBlue vulnerability could
        be used to gain SYSTEM-level access on these machines. Post-exploitation
        activities revealed that sensitive files and credentials were
        accessible, confirming the potential for data
        compromise.</p><p>Screenshots and logs from the exploitation process
        have been included as evidence.</p>
      remediation: >-
        <p>To mitigate the EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerability, the following
        steps should be taken:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <strong>Apply Patches:</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately apply
        the MS17-010 security update provided by Microsoft to all vulnerable
        systems. This patch is available for supported and some unsupported
        Windows versions, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 7,
        and Windows Server 2008.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Regularly update systems
        with the latest security patches to prevent future
        exploitation.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Disable
        SMBv1:</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Disable SMBv1 on all systems, as it is an outdated protocol prone to
        exploitation. Use SMBv2 or SMBv3 instead, which are more secure. For
        Windows systems, you can disable SMBv1 using
        PowerShell:</p><p>Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName
        SMB1Protocol</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Network
        Segmentation:</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement proper network
        segmentation to isolate critical systems and limit lateral movement
        within the network. Restrict communication on port 445 (SMB) to trusted
        systems only.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Enable
        Host-Based Firewalls:</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Configure host-based
        firewalls to block inbound traffic on port 445 (SMB) unless explicitly
        required. This can significantly reduce the attack
        surface.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Implement
        Network Monitoring:</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitor network traffic
        for unusual activity, especially on ports associated with SMB (port
        445), and set up alerts for any potential exploitation
        attempts.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
        or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to identify and block malicious
        activity related to EternalBlue.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <strong>Access Control:</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit
        administrative privileges to minimize the impact of potential exploits.
        Ensure that users only have the necessary permissions for their
        roles.</p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable unnecessary services and protocols on
        all systems.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Regular
        Vulnerability Scanning:</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct regular
        vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate any unpatched or
        misconfigured systems in the
        network.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Backup and
        Disaster Recovery Plan:</strong></p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain regular,
        offline backups of critical data to ensure recovery in the event of an
        attack. Test backups frequently to ensure their integrity.</p>

      title: Werkzeug Debug Mode Enabled
      description: >-
        <p>Werkzeug's debug mode is intended for troubleshooting during
        development, but if enabled in a production environment, it poses
        significant security risks. When activated, it exposes detailed error
        messages, stack traces, and an interactive debugger that could allow
        attackers to execute arbitrary code within the application context. By
        default, Werkzeug's debugger is protected by a PIN-based mechanism to
        prevent unauthorized access. However, this PIN can be bypassed or
        discovered, and it should not be relied upon as a robust security
        measure, especially in a production environment.</p>
      remediation: >-
        <ul><li><p><strong>Disable Debug Mode:</strong> Ensure that the debug
        mode is turned off in production environments. This can typically be
        achieved by setting the <code>debug</code> parameter to
        <code>False</code> in your application configuration or environment
        variables.</p><ul><li><p>Example for Flask:
        <code>app.run(debug=False)</code></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Use
        Environment-Specific Settings:</strong> Implement environment-specific
        configurations to automatically disable debug mode in production
        environments. Ensure that your application distinguishes between
        development and production settings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Restrict
        Access:</strong> If debug mode must be temporarily enabled in a
        non-production environment, restrict access using IP whitelisting,
        authentication, or VPN to prevent unauthorized access.</p></li></ul>

        allowing potential attackers to discover and attempt to access it. These
        interfaces are designed for managing and configuring applications,
        systems, or services, and exposing them to the broader network poses a
        significant risk, as attackers could exploit weak credentials, unpatched
        vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations to gain unauthorized control.</p>
      remediation: >-
        <ul><li><p><strong>Restrict Access:</strong> Limit access to
        administrative interfaces by implementing network segmentation, access
        control lists (ACLs), or firewall rules to ensure that only authorized
        users or networks can reach the interface.</p></li><li><p><strong>Change
        Default Credentials:</strong> Avoid using default credentials for
        administrative interfaces to make them harder to
        access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regularly Monitor Access Logs:</strong>
        Implement logging and monitoring for administrative access attempts to
        detect any unauthorized or suspicious activity within the
        network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disable Unnecessary Interfaces:</strong>
        If the administrative interface is not required, disable or remove it to
        eliminate the risk entirely.</p></li></ul>

      title: Exposed PowerShell Web Access (PSWA)
      description: >-
        <p>PowerShell Web Access (PSWA) is a feature in Windows Server that
        allows users to run PowerShell commands and scripts remotely via a web
        browser. By web-based gateway, PSWA enables users to manage and automate
        tasks on Windows servers and computers from any device with internet
        access, without needing a direct remote desktop connection.</p>
      observation: >-
        <p>During the penetration test, Team 7 observed PSWA exposed on the
        <code>flakead.prod.oui.local</code> server.</p><img class="custom-image"

        via PSWA">
      remediation: >-
        <p>Team 7 recommends disabling PSWA or only exposing it within the
        internal network and replacing it the a more secure remote management
        solution such as RDP behind a VPN forwarded or SSH with public key
        authentication. See references for guides on disabling PSWA and
        configuring SSH and RDP for Windows.</p>

        due to it not being needed the sensitive PII should also be stored in a
        backend database stored with encryption.</p>

      title: Inappropriate Chatbot Responses
      description: >-
        <p>The chatbot was observed generating inappropriate, offensive, or
        unexpected responses when provided with specific inputs. This behavior
        occurs due to a lack of sufficient safeguards in processing user inputs
        and/or filtering the chatbot's outputs. Although this issue does not
        pose a direct security threat, it can harm user experience, reduce trust
        in the system, and potentially damage the organization’s reputation.</p>
      observation: >-
        <p>During testing, finals-12 was able to prompt the <a target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://yyy.chat">yyy.chat</a>
        chatbot in order to get it to respond to the user in an offensive
        manner. This may be something to take note of and put stricter input
        validation on this model. Although this poses no security risk the the
        Oui Croissant environment, it may damage the customer experience of Y as
        well as causing reputational damage.<br></p><img class="custom-image"

        remarks">
      remediation: >-
        <p>Increased input validation depends on how this chatbot is implemented
        (code/libraries used), but is the correct way of preventing this
        offensive output from the Y chatbot. Below is an example of a python
        library that can be used to enforce tighter restrictions on what data
        gets processed by the LLM model. AI experts could also be brought in to
        better train and test the model used on Y.</p>
