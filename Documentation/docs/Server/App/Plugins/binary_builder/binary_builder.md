# Binary Builder Server Plugin

The **Binary Builder Plugin** is designed to streamline the process of building binaries using Docker environments. It leverages Docker for creating isolated compilation environments, particularly for Rust binaries intended for cross-platform support. This setup is ideal for compiling binaries in a repeatable, modular, and scalable manner.

## Features

- **Docker Handler**: Manages Docker containers for isolated compilation environments.
- **Rust Compilation**: Supports cross-compilation of Rust binaries, specifically for Windows targets.

### Current Limitations
- Currently limited to Rust binaries.
- Support for other languages or environments may require additional configuration.

---

## Technical Details

### Important File Paths

- `./_docker/`: The main directory for Docker-related files, prefixed with `_` to avoid conflicts with the `docker` Python library.
  - `dockerfiles`: Directory for Dockerfiles used to build containers, each named according to the target environment (e.g., `debian_windows_x64.dockerfile`).
  
- `./data`: Directory to store output and working data.
  - `compiled`: Folder where all compiled binaries are stored after the build process, allowing easy access to the compiled files. Docker outputs compiled binaries directly into this folder.

### Dockerfile Conventions
Each Dockerfile is uniquely named to indicate the target operating system and architecture. Naming follows the pattern: `container-os_target-os_architecture.dockerfile`. Currently, each target OS and architecture requires a separate Dockerfile to ensure all dependencies are correctly handled.

### Supported Targets

The current plugin supports compiling the following target:
- **x64_windows_stageless**: A binary format optimized for Windows 64-bit without staging.

## API Endpoints

### `/binary_builder/<target>` - POST
Initiates the Docker build process for a specified target, compiling a binary based on the provided configuration.

## Full Compile Workflow

This workflow outlines the complete step-by-step process for compiling a binary through the Binary Builder Plugin:

1. **Configuration Loading**:
   - The configuration file (`config.yaml`) is loaded. This file contains all Docker and binary-specific information needed for the build, such as Dockerfile paths, descriptions, and the target language.

2. **User Request**:
   - The user initiates the build by selecting "Queue for Compilation" or hitting a designated endpoint in the plugin.

   Endpoints that trigger this process:
      - `/binary_builder/build/custom`
      - `/binary_builder/build/agents`
      - `/binary_builder/build/droppers`


3. **Plugin Request Handling**:
   - The plugin receives an HTTP request to the designated endpoint. This request includes target specifications (e.g., `x64_windows_dropper`).

4. **Initiate Build**:
   - The `build` function in the `docker_builder.py` module is called. 
   - This function uses the configurations from the `config.yaml` file to select the appropriate Dockerfile, configure the build context, and set the output directory.

5. **Docker Environment Setup**:
   - The Docker container is built with the specified Dockerfile, establishing the necessary environment for Rust cross-compilation (e.g., installing toolchains, dependencies).
   - The container copies source files (typically located in `agents/`) and compiles them according to build specifications.

6. **Binary Compilation and Output**:
   - After successful compilation, the resulting binaries are output into the `data/compiled` folder, which serves as the central location for all compiled binaries. 
   - Currently, these binaries are accessible through the `binary_builder/?` endpoint, where they can be retrieved or downloaded.

7. **Cleanup**:
   - The container is automatically removed post-build to maintain a clean environment and optimize resource usage.

### Configuration Example

The configuration for each binary target is specified in the `config.yaml` file. Each target includes a buildfile path, description, and language for build instructions:

```yaml
binaries:
   droppers:
      x64_windows_dropper: 
         buildfile: "_docker/dockerfiles/debian_windows_dropper_x64.dockerfile"
         description: "An x64 Windows dropper"
         language: "rust"
```

Each Dockerfile performs several critical steps:
- Sets up the required compilation environment (e.g., Rust toolchains, cross-compilation dependencies).
- Copies the source files from the `agents/` directory into the container.
- Compiles the binary during the build process.
- Outputs the compiled binary to the `data/compiled` directory, where it can be accessed by other components or endpoints.
