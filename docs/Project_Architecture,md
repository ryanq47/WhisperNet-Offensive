# Project Architecture


`config` - DIR: Holds the config files


`databases` - DIR: Holds databases


`modules` - DIR: Holds modules, which are non-flexible, and non-routable components of the application


`plugins` - DIR: Holds plugins, which are used to enhance the functionality of the app. Plugins *have* routable endpoints.
    What is a plugin? A plugin is a single python file that adds extensibilty to the app
