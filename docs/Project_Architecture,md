# Project Architecture


`config` - DIR: Holds the config files


`databases` - DIR: Holds databases, and database models


`modules` - DIR: Holds modules, which are non-flexible, and non-routable components of the application


`plugins` - DIR: Holds plugins, which are used to enhance the functionality of the app. Plugins *have* routable endpoints.
    What is a plugin? A plugin is a single python file that adds extensibilty to the app




# IN DEV/Ideas

Technologies to use & waht for: 
Redis: Shared fast data, such as command queues. PERSISTENT DATA DOES NOT GO HERE. IT WILL GO AWAY ON CRASH. used for multiple gunicorn workers/concurrency reasons. 

Neo4j: Data modeling of clients

How are things like commands run, etc going to be stored? Loggers. Log files will tell what's been run, responses, etc.
